This file provides a "course format", a general structure that all courses on
the UBC site share. They typically have a course code, credits, title, and
desription. They can also have prereqs, equivalents, and coreqs.
This file also provides some simple methods.

This takes an array of strings, and makes a new Course object.
Takes: Arr ([String])
    ASSUMES: len(Arr) >= 2
    First entry in Arr has the course code, credits, and title
    Second entry has course description
    Subsequent entries may have prereqs, equivalents, and/or coreqs
Returns: a Course object
